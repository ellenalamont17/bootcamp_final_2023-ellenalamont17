Photo Credits: [Wasowski Collection](https://www.wildflower.org/gallery/result.php?id_image=24692)\n","\n","Native grasslands account for nearly a quarter of ground surface vegetative cover, but have suffered significant global losses in habitat. While anthropogenic encroachment has contributed to these losses, dramatic changes in climate over the last few decades has taken a toll on grassland ecosystems (Bond, 2008). Consequently, native grasslands are endangered ecosystems, posing economic and ecological threats. Unfortunately, given the complications of a changing climate, restoration of native grasslands is all but simple. Efforts to rebuild and conserve grassland ecosystems now require careful planning and must account for future changes in climate inorder to build ecologic resilence (Kane et al., 2017). Ecologic planning will have to account for longer duration droughts, increased temperatures, and more variable extreme precipitation events predicted by climate forecasts. The time available to understand, conserve, and restore these critical ecosystems are shrinking rapidly, required immediate action.\n","\n","The purpose of this project is to create a habitat suitability model for one variety of native grass, Sorghastrum nutans, more commonly known as Indiangrass, is a native, warm season perennial grass commonly found between the east coast and Rocky Mountains in the United States. It is the second most abundant tall grass species in North America [(Silletti, 2002)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/20051307.pdf?casa_token=1qAlFkV1krQAAAAA:wBQHle8JfCNPdjWcJwl08FTB5yWfkqHSfeQEHA_U6DwX2KPx7xwEhE0_PoXB3_VT4DllfADhZhIdcUEzsJFcXXx-whL2kFuiWMg1iFaf_E6AnDBSnTIn). \n","\n","Indiangrass grows between 3-8 feet tall, has 10-20 inch leaf blades and a hairy stalk. For habitat, Indiangrass often occurs in regions receiving 11-45 inches of annual precipitation, preferrs deep, moist soils ranging from heavy clays to sands, and a pH range of 4.8 - 8.0. However, the species is has a moderate tolerance for salinity, drought, and periodic burning [(Brakie, 2017)](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/plantmaterials/etpmcpg13196.pdf). Studies of long term abundance patterns and responses of Sorghastrum nutans to climate and environmental changes suggest that variations in annual precipitation impacted ground cover, but that the response to increased fire frequency was an increase in ground cover, indicating species resilience (Silletti, 2002).\n","\n","**References**\n","\n","Bond, W.J.
